#This is a template that stores keys and values.
#These values you can get using placeholders (it also works with PlaceholderAPI).
#Placeholders look like in PlaceholderAPI: %lngbr_<key>% -> %lngbr_another.directory.subdirectory.key1%
#They will translate this key in placeholder into the player's chosen language value.
#Values can be colored using minecraft colors (&a) or hex colors (&#FFFFFF).
#
#You can write keys as you wish (you can see examples below).
#
#another.directory.subdirectory.key1: value1
#somedir.directory:
#  randomkey: randomvalue
#directory:
#  subdirectory:
#    key2: value2
#    key3: value3
#    key4: value4
#    randomdirectory:
#      randomsubdirectory:
#        key5: value5
