# This is a template that stores keys and values.
# These values you can get using placeholders (it also works with PlaceholderAPI).
# Placeholders look like in PlaceholderAPI: %lngbr_<key>% -> %lngbr_another.directory.subdirectory.key1%
# They will translate this key in placeholder into the player's chosen language value.
# Values can be colored using minecraft colors (&a) or hex colors (&#FFFFFF).
#
# Attention! If you're going to use colors, be sure to put the apostrophe (') on both sides
# like '&#e02b8cvalue' or else the key will be deleted!
#
#
# You can write keys as you wish (you can see example below).
#
# another.directory.subdirectory.key1: value1
# somedir.directory:
#  randomkey: randomvalue
# directory:
#  subdirectory:
#    key2: value2
#    key3: value3
#    key4: value4
#    randomdirectory:
#      randomsubdirectory:
#        key5: value5
